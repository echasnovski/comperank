Description: Compute ranking and rating based on competition
    results. Methods of different nature are implemented: with fixed
    Head-to-Head structure, with variable Head-to-Head structure and with
    iterative nature. All algorithms are taken from the book 'Who’s #1?:
    The science of rating and ranking' by Amy N. Langville and Carl D.
    Meyer (2012, ISBN:978-0-691-15422-0).
