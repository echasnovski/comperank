#' Iterative rating method
#'
#' Functions to compute Iterative numeric [ratings][rating-ranking], i.e. which
#' are recomputed after every game, and corresponding
#' [rankings][rating-ranking].
#'
#' @inheritParams rate_massey
#' @param rate_fun Rating function (see Details).
#' @param initial_ratings Initial ratings (see Details).
#' @param type Value for `type` in [round_rank()]: `"desc"` or `"asc"`.
#' @inheritParams rank_massey
#'
#' @details Iterative ratings of group of players are recomputed after every
#' game based on players' game scores and their ratings just before the game.
#' Theoretically this kind of ratings can be non-numeric and be computed on
#' competition results with variable number of players but they rarely do. This
#' package provides functions for computing iterative __numeric__ ratings for
#' [pairgames][comperes::to_pairgames] (competition results with games only
#' between two players). Error is thrown if `cr_data` is not pairgames.
#'
#' Games in [widecr][comperes::widecr()] form are arranged in increasing order
#' of values in column `game` (if it is present) and processed from first to
#' last row.
#'
#' `NA` values in column `player` are allowed. These players are treated as
#' 'ghosts': players of the same rating as opponent before the game. 'Ghosts'
#' are not actual players so they don't appear in the output of
#' `rate_iterative()`. For games between two 'ghosts' ratings before and after
#' the game are set to 0.
#'
#' The core of the rating system is `rate_fun`. It should take the
#' following arguments:
#' - __rating1__ - Rating of player1 before the game.
#' - __score1__ - Score of player1 in the game.
#' - __rating2__ - Rating of player2 before the game.
#' - __score2__ - Score of player2 in the game.
#'
#' `rate_fun` should return a numeric vector of length 2: first element being a
#' rating of player1 after the game, second - of player2.
#'
#' Ratings are computed based only on games between players of interest (see
#' Players) and `NA` values.
#'
#' Initial ratings should be defined with argument `initial_ratings`. It
#' can be:
#'
#' - A single numeric value. In this case initial ratings for all players are
#' set to this value.
#'
#' - A named vector of ratings. All non-`NA` players, for which rating is
#' computed, should be present in its names (as character representation of
#' players' actual identifiers).
#'
#' - A data frame with first column representing player and second - initial
#' rating. It will be converted to named vector with
#' [deframe()][tibble::deframe()] from `tibble` package.
#'
#' @inheritSection massey Players
#'
#' @return `rate_iterative()` returns a [tibble][tibble::tibble] with columns
#' `player` (player identifier) and `rating_iterative` (Iterative
#' [ratings][rating-ranking], based on row order, by the end of competition
#' results). __Interpretation of numbers depends on rating function
#' `rate_fun`__.
#'
#' `rank_iterative()` returns a `tibble` with columns `player`,
#' `rating_iterative` (if `keep_rating = TRUE`) and `ranking_iterative`
#' (Iterative [ranking][rating-ranking] computed with [round_rank()] based on
#' specified `type`).
#'
#' `add_iterative_ratings()` returns a [widecr][comperes::widecr()] form of
#' `cr_data` with four rating columns added:
#' - __rating1Before__ - Rating of player1 before the game.
#' - __rating2Before__ - Rating of player2 before the game.
#' - __rating1After__ - Rating of player1 after the game.
#' - __rating2After__ - Rating of player2 after the game.
